## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own media entries, while admins have full control over all entries.
- **Admin Approval Workflow**: New entries submitted by regular users are held in a `pending` state and are only publicly visible after an administrator approves them.
- **Dynamic Data Table**: Media entries are displayed in a responsive table with infinite scroll for a smooth user experience.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Users can only edit or delete entries they have created, while admins have full control over all entries.

### Advanced Features
- **Secure JWT Authentication**: Complete user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens, with sessions persisted in local storage.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between `admin` (full access) and `user` roles to manage permissions.
- **Advanced Filtering & Search**: The dashboard includes controls to filter entries by type, industry, and search by keywords.
- **Shareable Filter Links**: The application state for filters is persisted in the URL, allowing users to share links to specific views.
- **API Documentation**: A live, interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is served directly from the backend.
- **Containerized Environment**: The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) can be launched with a single Docker Compose command.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically run tests on every pull request, ensuring code quality.

## ‚ö° Setup Instructions

### 1. Local Environment Setup

#### Backend
```sh
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
Now, open the newly created .env file and add your credentials for MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, and the default admin credentials for the seeder.

sh
Copy code
# 4. Start the backend server
npm start
The backend will be running on:
üëâ http://localhost:5001

Frontend
Open a new terminal for the frontend.

sh
Copy code
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create the environment file
# Create a new .env file in the /frontend directory and add the following:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001

# 4. Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
The frontend will be running on:
üëâ http://localhost:5173

2. Docker Environment Setup
This is the recommended method for a quick and consistent setup.

sh
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project-root
Ensure you have a .env file in the backend directory with your JWT_SECRET defined.

From the root directory of the project, run:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the images for the frontend and backend, and start all three services.

Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost

Backend API ‚Üí http://localhost:5001

üì¶ Database Schema and Seeding
The application uses Mongoose for schema management.
Schema definitions can be found in:

bash
Copy code
backend/src/models/
To populate the database with a default admin user and sample data, run the seeder script:

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This will wipe all existing data.

sh
Copy code
# Run this command from the /backend directory
npm run seed
üìë API Documentation
The backend includes interactive API documentation served by Swagger UI.
Once the backend server is running, access it at:

üëâ http://localhost:5001/api-docs

üß™ Testing & Continuous Integration
Running Tests
Backend Tests:

sh
Copy code
cd backend
npm test
Frontend Tests (setup pending):

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
npm test
Continuous Integration (CI)
A GitHub Actions workflow is configured at:

bash
Copy code
.github/workflows/ci.yml
This workflow automatically runs the backend test suite on every push and pull request to the main branch to ensure code integrity.
